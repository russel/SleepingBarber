#  This is a model of the "The Sleeping Barber" problem
#  (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem) in Python (http://www.python.org).

#  The barber's shop is modelled as a process with an event queue, it receives events from the outside world
#  (new customers arriving) and from the barbers (customers with fully trimmed barnets).  The waiting chairs
#  are modelled as a common queue to which all the barbers have shared access.  Barbers are modelled with a
#  process getting clients from the queue -- a blocking read models being asleep in the cutting chair when
#  not actively processing a customer. In effect this is an Actor Model reactor approach with each process
#  using a blocking read on its event queue but with barbers sharing a queue.  Because we are using what is
#  effectively an Actor Model approach we have to use case classes so as to carry appropriate infomration in
#  the messages sent to the shop process.

#  This should work with both Python 2 and Python 3.  Use range everywhere, even where with Python 2 xrange
#  would be preferred so as to ensure it all works with both versions.
