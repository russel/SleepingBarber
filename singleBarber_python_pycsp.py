#  This is a model of the "The Sleeping Barber" problem using PyCSP,
#  cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem.

#  Copyright Â© 2009-10 Russel Winder

#  The barber's shop and the barber are modelled with processes.  Channels are used to pass customer objects
#  from the shop to the barber.  The current arrangement assumes there is only one barber.

#  This should work with both Python 2 and Python 3.  Use range everywhere, even where with Python 2 xrange
#  would be preferred so as to ensure it all works with both versions.
