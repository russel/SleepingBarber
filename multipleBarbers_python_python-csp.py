#  This is a model of the "The Sleeping Barber" problem,
#  cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem.

#  Copyright Â© 2009-10 Russel Winder

#  The barber's shop and the barber are modelled with processes.  Channels are used to pass customer objects
#  from the shop to the barber.  The current arrangement assumes there is only one barber.

#  The initial expectation for the behaviour of alt.select ( ) in:
#
#    alt = Alt ( channel_A , channel_B )
#    returnValue = alt.select ( )
#
#  is that returnValue is the channel ready to be read.  Python-CSP however merges the select and read and
#  so does the read and returnValue is the datum from the alt.select ( ) (Mount, personal communication).
#  This means we cannot select on the channel and hence cannot just ship round Customer objects, we have to
#  box the Customer object in a case class instance so that we can select on the type of the datum.  In this
#  sense Python-CSP is actually closer to Actor Model semantics that to CSP despite being an implementation
#  of CSP.
