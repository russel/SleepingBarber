This directory contains various implementations in various programming languages of the "Sleeping Barber
Problem".  The genesis of the problem is a process scheduling problem in operating systems first put forward
by Edsgar Dijkstra.  The Wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem presents the
pseudocode for a solution to the process scheduling problem.  The solutions in this collection tend more
towards treating the problem as one in need of simulation. 

Various different idioms and techniques in the various languages are tried as part of showing which
languages are better than others for this problem.  Also the examples investigate the properties of, and
indeed idioms and techniques appropriate to, the various languages.
