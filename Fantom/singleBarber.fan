 *
 *  The barber sleeping is modelled by the barber actor blocking awaiting a message.  The barber's chairs
 *  are modelled by the message queue between the shop actor and the barber actor.  As the queue is an
 *  arbitrary length list, the shop object has to control how many customers are allowed into the queue.

 *  This is only one of a potentially infinite number of correct versions.
