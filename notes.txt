PyCSP single barber never turns a customer away => synchronization issue!
Python-CSP version currently blocks.

PyCSP and Python-CSP have 4 encoded instead of numberOfWatingSeats parameter.

Why does the D version never reject anyone?


Groovy CSP doesn't terminate properly.  It also never turns away a client.

Is never turning a customer way implying that the acceptance of a customer is being controlled at the shop
door?

multipleBarbers_python_pycsp.py  doesn't terminate correctly.
