PyCSP single barber never turns a customer away => synchronization issue!
Python-CSP version currently blocks.

PyCSP and Python-CSP have 4 encoded instead of numberOfWaitingSeats parameter.

Why does the D version never reject anyone?



Is never turning a customer way implying that the acceptance of a customer is being controlled at the shop
door?

multipleBarbers_python_pycsp.py  doesn't terminate correctly.
